v2.1.1
- Fixed a bug that prevented spaces in the "About me" field

v2.1
- Removed WULoginProfileImage script as it's become completely redundant
- User profile image is automatically fetched if the email is fetched during login
- User profile image is now available under WULogin.user_gravatar if fetched or will be null otherwise
- Moved gravatar type seection to WULogin base class
- Added UGUI support and a new prefab to use in place of the OnGUI version (Leaving the OnGUI version as legacy)

v2.03
- Fixed a bug with the WPServer that causes issue with the WUData kit

v2.02
- Enabled custom error handling in the event of the server reporting something going wrong

v2.01
- Fixed a bug to enable Firefox support

v2.0
- This update requires that the wuss_login plugin on the website be replaced with this version
- Introduced an extra step before you can use the login kit. In Start, call InitLoginSystem as early as possible
- Replaced the meta data request CSV string field with a string array for simplicity
- Extracted the server contact routines into a generic, standalone class (WPServer) to be shared by all other WUSS kits
- Removed the functions that trigger the delegate actions and call them from the new WPServer class directly
- Also removed the website URL and online/offline checks from WULogin to WPServer.
- The WULogin prefab is updated to hold the WUServer component by default but WUServer can be placed on another object if desired
- Calling the server now requires a lot more params due to it's generic nature. All functions updated to include them for you
- Delegate functions now receive server responses as "CML" objects, not as the generic "object" class
	- This saves you the initial explicit casting before you can use it
	- but also means you need to fetch the data from within the response using response[0] or response.GetFirstNodeOfType(LOGINConstant) as appropriate
	- You now also get access to the entire server response, including error messages and debug info, if any
- Added two new constants: login_filepath and LOGINConstant.
- Login_filepath is for internal use only. LOGINConstant matches the return type from the server
- Added a WULActions enum that I use to call the server, instead of using the WULStates enum used for the GUI state machine
- WPServer now sends actions as strings instead of ints
- Sorted the compatibility issue that prevented the kit from working on PS Vita and Firefox browser
	- It should now work with everything! Testing continues
- Moved ShowPleaseWait function into WPServer so all kits can fetch it from there instead of creating duplicate code

On the server
- Updated the Wordpress plugin to make the login kit's code more easily readable in existing and future add-on components
- Removed the pre- and post- functions as they didn't serve any real purpose. If you need it back, please let me know.
- Now uses AJAX functions to trigger the code when appropriate instead of forcing the code to run during the SHUTDOWN action
- AJAX functions also add an extra level of protection against calling code while not logged in
- Renamed the functions in a paranoia driven attempt at website hacking prevention
- Force function name prefixes to prevent my code from being used as an exploit to run arbitrary code on your site

v1.3
- This update requires that the WUPlugin on the website be replaced with this version
- WULogin prefab now allows you to specify what fields to return upon login and also allows you to fetch any piece of info from the usermeta table. 
- All the info returned during login is stored in a publicly accessible cmlData variable called fetched_info
- logged_in variable is now set automatically upon login and logout. You no longer need to do this manually in the GUI script
- WULogin now contains a Static WULogin.GameID field that other kits can use to make sure all WU kits use the same game ID
- WUServer now contains a public function to generate the WWW request. All other WU kits will use this function to contact the server
- WUServer has been updated to fix some login issues on iOS
- Fixed the bug where logging in without first logging out caused the previous login's cookie to be used
- You are now able to test web player projects in the editor
- Updated WULProfileImage to only fetch personal info if the email was not requested during login, thereby saving one extra round trip to the server
- Now adds a WUL define to the project

v1.22
- Modified the method for fetching your gravatar image. You can use it as always or you can now pass in the type of image of
gravatar you want to show. Simply use the new WULGravatarTypes enum as the second param.
- Updated the WULProfileImage script so you can select your gravatar type from the inspector
- Added the WUServer_Instance property to WUServer in preparation for dependent kit updates

v1.21
- Modified the WUCookie script to remove the deprecated warning introduced in Unity 4.5 and thus made it more future proof

v1.2
- Added multisite installation support
- Added wulogin_pre and wulogin_post hooks for custom plugins
- Moved execution from immediately to Wordpress's 'shutdown' filter for improved compatability with 3rd party plugins on your website
NOTE: This update will break a previous install if installed on a multisite

v1.11
- Fixed a security issue introduced in v1.1
- Modified this file so the upload would work...

v1.1
- Now includes a new class WULProfileImg. 
- After login, player's preofile image will be available from static WULProfileImg.ProfileImage
